# gcp_airflow_project

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end real-time financial sentiment analysis and anomaly detection system using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AI/ML, and NLP. It processes live stock prices, financial news, and tweets to extract sentiment insights and detect unusual market movements (e.g., insider trading, flash crashes).

ðŸš€ Tech Stack Used:
âœ… Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Cloud Composer, Looker Studio)
âœ… Airflow (DAGs for automated data ingestion & transformation)
âœ… Machine Learning (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders for anomaly detection)
âœ… NLP (FinBERT for sentiment analysis, NER for stock symbol extraction)
âœ… Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Processing & Visualization)

ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow
Step 1: Data Collection & Ingestion

Stock Market Data â†’ Fetched from Yahoo Finance API (Date, Open, Close, High, Low, Volume)
Financial News Data â†’ Extracted from News API (Title, Source, Published Date, Description)
Twitter Data â†’ Fetched from Twitter API (Tweets related to stocks, hashtags, timestamps)
Data is preprocessed and stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) before loading into BigQuery.

Step 2: Sentiment Analysis & NLP (AI & Data Science Focus)

FinBERT is used to classify tweets & news into Positive, Negative, Neutral Sentiment.
Named Entity Recognition (NER) extracts stock symbols & company names from text.
The final dataset is stored in BigQuery (finance_sentiment.stock_sentiment).

Step 3: Correlate Sentiment with Stock Prices (SQL in BigQuery)

Aggregated sentiment trends vs. stock price movements using SQL queries in BigQuery.
"Overall Sentiment" column generated to classify market sentiment shifts.

Step 4: Anomaly Detection (Machine Learning Focus)

Isolation Forest & Autoencoder Models detect unusual stock price movements (e.g., pump-and-dump, insider trading).
Cross-checks anomalies with news sentiment.

Step 5: Predictive Modeling (ML-Based Stock Price Forecasting)

Built ML models (LSTM, Random Forest) to predict stock price movements based on past price & sentiment trends.
Step 6: Data Pipeline Automation (Cloud Composer & Airflow DAGs)

Airflow DAG automates:
Data Ingestion (from APIs â†’ GCS â†’ BigQuery)
Sentiment Analysis & Storage
Anomaly Detection & Alerts
Step 7: Visualization (Looker Studio Dashboard)
